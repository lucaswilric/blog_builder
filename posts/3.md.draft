 * Measure change in complexity through *diff* analysis
  - Every decision removed is -1
  - Every decision added is + 1
  - Becomes meaningful when related to story points completed, or a similar measure
  - Measures only code that has changed - i.e. the effect that WE are having as a team
  - Need to tag commits or something like that, so our measurement tool knows what it should be measuring
  - Need to do it twice for a complete picture - Once for TFS, once for git.
